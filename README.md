A list of Fakemon I have commissioned through out the years & am selling to others to buy. I have been given permission from the artists to sell. Costs can be found below. 
I greatly request, that if you make sprites & PBS info for them, you contribute such to the EE FFPR thread as well.
The thread can be found at https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1534/. Ultimately up to you though!
Below credits only include the designer but please credit me as well!
